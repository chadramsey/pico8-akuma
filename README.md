## Akuma
### A top-down adventure for the PICO-8
Akuma is a project first intended for submission to [Game Off 2018](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2018), but has instead shifted to become an open source project to serve as a template for a top-down adventure featured on the [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) fantasy console. Anyone interested may feel free to fork this project and expand on it, or simply peek in to see how certain mechanics are implemented for their own projects.
